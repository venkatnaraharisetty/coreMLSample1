# coreMLSample1

This project consists of sample iOS application used to recognize objects using iOS coreML framework.
I have used Inception V3 pre trained model in this project.

The app will open custom camera view by default and once use taps on screen it will capture image and checks Inception model for object.
Once object is found it will do a service call to wikipedia and gets infromation about the object and displays in the screen.
Detail View will dispaly the object name, accuray of the object result and captured image along with wikipedia description. 

## Sample flow will be as below:
